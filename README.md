## Graeme Paterson

I am a future full stack web developer currently in the deep-end at Makers Academy, and loving every minute. With ten years experience working with patients in public healthcare systems I have a passion for providing better services to society and ensuring that everyone from our communities have equal access to healthcare.

I have an untapped love for design and art. I am interested in how products, fashion and events can become more sustainable.

## Hobbies

I love food - cooking it, eating it, trying out new places, new meals, new ingredients. I cook a lot with Asian flavours but my biggest strength is my secret recipe extra crispy roast potatoes which my friends request every Christmas. My second love is music. Seeing live music still gives me a huge buzz and a feeling of being energised after a great show.
Sports, and watching sport is my default way to relax. It doesn’t matter what sport or who’s playing; as long as there’s a race or a ball flying around I’m in.
